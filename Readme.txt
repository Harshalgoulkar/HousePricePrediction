Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:-a) Create a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the
price of the house given the various factors across the market.
b) Determine the relationship between the house features and how the
price varies based on this.
Task3:- Come up with suggestions for the customer to buy the house according
to the area, price and other requirements.

Dataset Description:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won&#39;t begin with
the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this
playground competition&#39;s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations
than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in
Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
